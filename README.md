## Homework2 UML/OCL

Modeling an online store (Amazon like), through:

1. Usecase analysis, with: 
  - [Actors and stakeholder table](./ActorsTable.md)
  - One [use-case diagram](./uc-diagram.md)
  - One detailed written [use case](./Use-case.md) -- ([Make Purchase](./Make-Purchase Case.md))
1. Four diagrams: [Sequence](./se-diagram.md), [Class](./class-diagram.md), [Activity](./activityDiagram-UML.md), [Component](./sequenceDiagram-UML.md)|[Deployment]()
1. [OCL]: One diagram with constrains (see CAR example in lecture slides)

The models should be simple but not too simplistic! Using some non trivial UML constructs.
